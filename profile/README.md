## Abstract
> Over 40% of people will experience some form of memory loss by the time they turn 60 years old. While memory loss and cognitive impairments come in many forms, one of the most common symptoms includes misplacing important objects such as wallets, keys, hearing aids, and glasses. This significantly impacts the ability of elderly people to live independently. Coupled with declining eyesight and physical strength, searching through an entire living space for objects can be extremely strenuous for elderly people, and can often end up being unsuccessful. While current widespread solutions in production to track and locate missing objects, such as Air Tags and Tile Trackers, use Bluetooth transmitters, the resolution of these devices is limited to areas often larger than the entire house, making it unsuitable for isolating a specific area of the house for an elderly person to search. Thus, we propose a cost-effective and user-friendly rover-based design for a misplaced item locator. Some of technologies we use include state of the art object localizers, a modular rover chasis, and a user-friendly mobile application and cloud database.
